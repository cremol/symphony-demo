## Synopsis

Format text using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax. This release also passes any output through the [HTML Purifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/) library.

## Installation & Updating

Although the update should address this, fields that used a previous version (< 1.10) may appear to have no formatter specified and will need to be set manually.

Information about [installing and updating extensions](http://getsymphony.com/learn/tasks/view/install-an-extension/) can be found in the Symphony documentation at <http://getsymphony.com/learn/>.
