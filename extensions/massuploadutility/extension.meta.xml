		</release>

		</release>
		<release version="0.9.7" date="2011-11-15" min="2.2" max="2.2.4">
            * Wasn't properly handling a redirect, should be taken care of, thanks David!
		</release>
		<release version="0.9.6" date="2011-10-28" min="2.2" max="2.2.4">
            * Properly fires the backend events: _EntryPreCreate_ and _EntryPostCreate_
            * Backend stuff, no longer uses event, uses the built in actionNew function of contentPublish
		</release>
		<release version="0.9.5" date="2011-09-25" min="2.2" max="2.2.4">
            * No longer clears files from the input[file] box if failed
            * Under the hood changes, no longer duplicates Symphony code, uses a custom event to add entries. Inspiration and thanks to Nick Dunn and his REST API extension!
            * Will highlight which fields have problems and display errors on them (except the upload field). This may get obnoxious and I might turn it off. This is instead of showing them in the queue list. It's customizable by changing a variable in the javascript.

            * A quick blurb to let the user know they can upload multiple files
            * Checking for HTML5 support
            * Added support for using variables in any other input field, like {$number} will dynamically change
            * When selecting files, they're populated to the queue so you know you queued files
