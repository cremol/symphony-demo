# Subsection Manager 3

![Subsection Manager](http://projekte.nilshoerrmann.de/extensions/subsectionmanager/sym_subsectionmanager.png)

Symphony offers an easy way to [create sections](http://symphony-cms.com/learn/concepts/view/sections/) and [model the fields](http://symphony-cms.com/learn/concepts/view/fields/) the way you like. Nevertheless, from time to time you need to connect the content of two sections: you might have an articles section you'd like to link images to, or you are building a books section you'd like to connect with authors. With a default Symphony install, you can use select boxes or selectbox links to create these connections, but you will not be able to see and manage all your content at once. The Subsection Manager tries to solve this problem by providing an inline management of another section's content. By adding the Subsection Manager field to your parent section, you can integrate another section as a subsection. The subsection's entries can be managed  through the inline interface as well as the regular Symphony section entry list. You can opt for inline editing only by simply hiding the specified section from the menu.

## Subsection Tab

As of version 3.5, Subsection Tabs have been removed. If you need a tabbed interface, please have a look at [Parenthesis Tabs](https://github.com/hananils/parenthesistabs) or [Publish Tabs](https://github.com/symphonists/publish_tabs).

## Installation

Information about [installing and updating extensions](http://symphony-cms.com/learn/tasks/view/install-an-extension/) can be found in the Symphony documentation at <http://symphony-cms.com/learn/>.

## Updating

To update Subsection Manager to a newer version perform the following steps:

- Make sure that you have a working backup of your Symphony install.
- Update the Subsection Manager folder by either updating the submodule or by replacing the files manually.
- Log into the backend and enable the Subsection Manager extension to run the update script.

**Updating to version 2.0:** Please note that this is major release and that you will have to reset item sorting and included elements manually.

**Updating to version 3.0:** This version drops update support for old Mediathek fields.

**Updating to version 3.5:** This version removes support for Subsection Tabs.
