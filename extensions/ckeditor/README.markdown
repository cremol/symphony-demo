## Built-in file browser

This Symphony extension comes with a built-in file browser that is compatible with CKEditor. This file browser uses Symphony sections to store and retrieve uploaded files. It works as follows:

 * Make sure you have created at least one section for your uploaded files with a 'File Upload' field attached;
 * Go to Symphony's System Preferences and make the CKEditor file browser available to one or more of your sections;
 * Once you've enabled the file browser for at least one of your sections, you make use of the 'Browse Server' button in CKEditor to select existing files from within your section and add them to the entry you are editing. You can also upload new files using the file browser on the fly!
