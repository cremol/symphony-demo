This ensemble is the result of a demo-site, that i made to explore some of Symphony's features and it's user friendly back-end.

The design is insprired by symphony's back-end, but fully customizable. 
You can experiment with body, header, menu and caption colors in the 'preferences' section.
Also included a complete reference to the google webfont directory, so you can choose from over a hundred webfonts for website title and captions.
Entering your favourite twitter username2 will display it's tweets on the homepage!

Pages and a recursive navigation can be created through entries in the 'pages' section.

The pages are built out of a single template, with optional sidebar and / or slideshow.

The homepage consists of a blog, showing text, an optional gallery and comments.
